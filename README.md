# Human Debris Archive

This project is an archive of the Human Debris project, a collection of maps, mods, and programs developed by Jason Brownlee for the computer game Quake III Arena between 1999 and 2001 (first few years of university).

The website was hosted on `http://zygote.alphalink.com.au/humadebris/` and then moved to `http://planetquake.com/humandebris`.

Additionally, two articles were written on AI game development for `http://ai-depot.com` and are also included in this archive.

There is also a scan of an article in PCPowerplay magazine about one of the mods.
