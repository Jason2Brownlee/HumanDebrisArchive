<br><p>
<u><b>Making Maps:</b></u>
<br>
Making maps for this mod is really simple. When you download this mod, an example
.MAP file is included in the archive. Simply load it up in q3Radient and see how it
was done. You can use the example map as a base if you want. If you have made a map,
package it into a .PK3 with a levelshot, .aas file, and .arena file and post a
message on our forum or email us so we can add it to the downloads section.
<br><br>
If you are unsure how to package it up email the map to us and we will package it up for you.
