<u><b>In Depth:</b></u>
<br>
All players spawn into the map with a rocket launcher and unlimited ammunition. There are no other
weapons at all. There are five rocket launchers from which to choose. To select which rocket launcher
you want to use for a game you must change the value of the 'g_rocket' cvar. Once this cvar has been
changed the map must be restarted.
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong> Only the server can change the value of this cvar.
<br><br>
Here are a list of the five possible values for the cvar (five possible rocket launchers).<br>
<table border="0">
<tr><td><b>0</b> == <u>Classic Rocket Launcher:</u> This is the normal Quake3:Arena rocket launcher.

</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>1</b> == <u>Effected By Gravity:</u> All rockets are effected by gravity.

</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>2</b> == <u>Homing Rockets:</u> These are rockets that home in on their target.

</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>3</b> == <u>Rapid Fire Rockets:</u> These are rockets that fire twice as fast as normal, but hurt half as much.

</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>4</b> == <u>Laser Guided Rockets:</u> These are laser guided rockets that are very similar to the ones in Half-Life. The
Crosshair is used as the laser. Which ever direction you point it, the rocket will head towards.
</td></tr>
