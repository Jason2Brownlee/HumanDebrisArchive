Map editor:   Q3Eradient
Build Time:   2-3 Hours Total
Compile Time: 2.5 mins (vis=full light=extra)

I got a bit bored, so I decided to mess with Q3Eradient some more. The product was the '2kool' level.
This map is based on a small Quake2 map I played and enjoyed.

Unzip the .pk3 file into your quake3\baseq3\ directory.
Load up quake3 (Full Version) and type: 
\sv_pure 0 
into the console. This will allow you to play user maps. Then type:
\map 2kool 

The map can also be accessed through the skirmish menu (under the singleplayer menu).

I haven't played it against humans yet, so if you do email me and tell me what its like. 
The map can be used as a 1v1 tournament because it’s so small. 
I find it a lot more fun with about 4-5 bots and me with the BFG :)
